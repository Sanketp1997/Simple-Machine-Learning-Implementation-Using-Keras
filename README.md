# Simple-Machine-Learning-Implementation-Using-Keras

## Basic Overview:

This is a very Simple Machine Learning Example Implemented with Keras model. System simply classifies the data with it's sum, If the sum of integers given as data is greater than 10(i.e two digit) then it will classify as yes. Else it will classify as no. 

## Project Files:

Repository contains one [.ipynb](https://github.com/Sanketp1997/Simple-Machine-Learning-Implementation-Using-Keras/blob/master/simple_ml.ipynb) file and one dataset file [mydataset.csv](https://github.com/Sanketp1997/Simple-Machine-Learning-Implementation-Using-Keras/blob/master/mydata1.csv).
The csv file contains 4 fields (3 intergers and a result).

## Requirements:

Install all necessary libraries (check [.ipynb](https://github.com/Sanketp1997/Simple-Machine-Learning-Implementation-Using-Keras/blob/master/simple_ml.ipynb) import statements.)

## Testing:

You can test the program with your own inputs as follows : { p =estimator.predict(numpy.array([[x,y,z]],numpy.int32)) }.
Enter values of 'x','y' and 'z'.
